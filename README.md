# First-CS-260-Project
Project number that is a program of a bag of marbles using C++.

## Marbles Project 
- I would say that a bag of marbles program can have quite a few different options:
- Variables: Different colors, amount of marbles, different patterened marbles, maybe even different materials, sizes, weight.
- Behaviors: Grabbing one marble at a time, grabbing multiple marbles, different variations of colors and the amount of a certain color, the bag could be full or --   empty, a marble can be taken out, marbles can be added back.
1)What makes a marble? A marble is round(and usually small) and can be different diameters, colors, and weights. To make this work in a program you would have to
  name these variables and assigning these attributes. 
2) A way to add new marbles: I truthfully do not know what anythng is called in C++ I am stuck on Python names. But I would create a bunch of variables to label the co,ors and the amoun tof each marble then I would create a random generator and create a user input and ask them to input a number then ask if they would like to add or remove marbles. 
3) I would do the exact same thing as above but instead of adding I would only allow the removal of marbles. I would have a counter that lets me know how many marbles I have and how many I have taken out/put in. 
4) I would test to make sure that a user could not input a number of marbles we did not have, as in I would set an amount such as only 38 marbles. I would do this by sending an error to the user when they entered too many marbles. 

5) I realized last second I could not run my code in my terminal I have no idea why yet, but I have already done a similar assignment so I changed a few things and didn't get any errors but plan to fix it when I fix whatver is wrong with my terminal.
